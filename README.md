# Robotic-Car-for-Fire-Detection
In this project, we developed a Raspberry Pi-based robotic car equipped with a Pi Camera for fire detection as well as for live  video feed. The car can be controlled remotely by the user through WiFi. Additionally, it gathers temperature and humidity data, sending it to a Google spreadsheet hosted in Google Drive for storage and analysis.
