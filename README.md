# Robotic-Car-for-Fire-Detection
In this project, we developed a Raspberry Pi-based robotic car equipped with a Pi Camera for fire detection. The car can be controlled remotely by the user through WiFi. Additionally, it gathers temperature and humidity data, sending it to a Google Cloud-hosted Excel sheet for storage and analysis.
